## Description

The project is a web-based application designed to run SQL queries and display the results of the queries within the application. It provides users with a space to input SQL queries, and upon execution, the application showcases the corresponding table of data as the result. This project serves as a dummy application, and no backend, query engine, or syntax validation is required.

The application's frontend is implemented using a JavaScript framework, React, to ensure a responsive and efficient user experience. Users, especially data analysts, will find this application useful for quick SQL query execution and data visualization. While the application does not require a live connection to a database, it offers more than one pre-defined query along with its corresponding data table, allowing users to toggle between different queries and view the data associated with each query.

The project prioritizes simplicity and user-friendliness, aiming to provide a smooth user experience while showcasing fundamental coding practices and performance optimization.

Overall, this application represents a frontend engineering challenge that demonstrates the developer's proficiency in designing, building, and optimizing web-based applications with a focus on usability and performance.
